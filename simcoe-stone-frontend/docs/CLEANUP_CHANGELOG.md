# Project Cleanup - September 8, 2025

- Moved operational/status markdowns from project root to `docs/ops/`.
- Moved architecture notes from `StoneMasonryCa_notes/` into `docs/architecture/StoneMasonryCa_notes/`.
- Added VS Code workspace file `simcoe-stone-frontend.code-workspace` for single-folder workspace.
- Left `build/`, `public/`, `src/`, and config files untouched.

How to open as its own workspace:
- In VS Code, open `simcoe-stone-frontend.code-workspace` (File > Open Workspace from File...).

Navigation:
- Operational notes: `docs/ops/`
- Architecture diagrams: `docs/architecture/StoneMasonryCa_notes/`
