# Operational Docs

This folder contains operational notes, status logs, and one-off checklists that were previously in the repository root. Keeping them here declutters the root while preserving history.

Key files moved:

- COMPLETE_PROJECT_STATUS.md
- COMPLETE_WEBSITE_INVENTORY.md
- EMERGENCY_SERVICES_RESTORED.md
- IMAGE_FIXES_COMPLETE.md
- IMAGE_PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZED.md

- PORTFOLIO_DESCRIPTIONS_RESTORED.md
- QUICK_NGROK_SETUP.md
- README-NEW.md
- SHARE_README.md
- SMART_LOADING_COMPLETE.md
- TYPESCRIPT_BUILD_FIX_COMPLETE.md

You can add new operational notes here as needed.
